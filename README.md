# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlexandreRavichandran
I am a former quality engineer who decided to discover the development world. After being self-taught for 1 year, I decided to join a development school to get good practices of coding.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests
Iâ€™m interested in web development and more specifically in back-end web development, and I'm very curious about cybersecurity
 

## ðŸ“« Learnings
 I'm specialized in back-end development, especially with Symfony Framework, but I am still curious about other back-end frameworks and event front-end frameworks
